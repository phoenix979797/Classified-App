              <p>
                The Refresh button is unique to WorkApp and ensures that the
                Workapp User Community are only receiving the most current and
                relevant data for their search. We have all been frustrated with
                search results where we call the person to find that the item is
                no longer available. WorkApp eliminates that problem. Take a
                second to refresh your post and get prioritised on the search
                results. No need to pay to boost your post - simply press the
                Refresh button.

              <p>
                A registered user in WorkApp can have unlimited Profiles and
                Posts. A Profile is a persona or entity that the person wishes
                to promote. This can be one or more businesses or one or more
                Worker Profiles - tailored for each type of work they seek.
                Profiles are used ongoing whilst Posts are classifieds, which
                are temporary and used for listing items for sale, rent or job
                vacancies and events that have an end date.

              <p>
                Profiles and Posts have varying expiry times depending on the
                type of profile or post. For example, Business and Community
                Profiles expire every 30 days while Job & Event Posts expire on
                the applications closing date or the Event date. All other Posts
                and Profiles expire in 7 days from the date of last Refresh. You
                can refresh all Profiles and Posts as often as you like which
                will boost the listing to the top of search results as well as
                renew it for a further 7 or 30 days depending on the listing
                type.

              <p>
                WorkApp currently has PayPal integration to make it easier for
                buyers to pay sellers. Other payment gateways will be added in
                future releases. By specifying your preferred payment method in
                Account Settings, the Buyers will know if you accept PayPal and
                choose to pay you accordingly. WorkApp does not charge you any
                fees or commissions and these details are not disclosed to
                anyone except for payment processing purposes.

              <p>
                WorkApp notifications are sent at predetermined times as a
                reminder to Refresh your Profiles and Posts. 6am reminder is
                important for Workers whose profiles expire that day and are
                still available for work and 12pm is only sent if you
                haven&apos;t refreshed your post or profile by then. We really
                don&apos;t want you to miss out by having your profiles and
                posts expire.
