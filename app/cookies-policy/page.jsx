                    around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works,
                    for example, by ensuring that users are able to find what they are looking for easily.
                    We use third party cookies, such as those provided via the Google Analytics service. The
                    information passed back to Google for use with Google Analytics is anonymous.

                    including preferences and habits, we are able to make your visit to our website
                    more productive. For example, some cookies remember your language or preferences so
                    that you do not have to repeatedly make these choices. We also use cookies to help us with geolocation
                    tracking in order to present you with more relevant listings.
